//Exercise Name: Mini Challenge Two To Four- Endpoint

// Brief Description of what I did: Endpoints:

1. Create an endpoint that accepts 2 numbers. Add both numbers and print out result in a sentence

   - Example results, "The sum of 2 and 2 is 4."

2. Create endpoint that accepts 2 inputs.Accepts a name and time
   The output is sentence that tells me who the person is and what time they woke up

3. Create endpoint that accepts 2 numbers. Results should print the following 2 statements:
   I. The first statement should tell me if the first number is greater than, less than or equal to the second number.
   II. The second statement should tell me if the second number is greater than, less than, or equal to the first number.

//Each endpoint has a controller and a service file.

//Person who Peer Reviewed my assignment: Trey
> Comments: Everything is looks good, except the adding 2 numbers answer is supposed to be in a full sentence.
